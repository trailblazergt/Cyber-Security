This is a repo for various small scripts related to cyber security. This repo will be constantly updated as I discover more on the subject. Thank you :)


YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or binary patterns. Each description, a.k.a rule, consists of a set of strings and a boolean expression which determine its logic.

For an indept analysis of YARA on how it works, refer to: http://paper.ijcsns.org/07_book/201705/20170511.pdf
